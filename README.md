## Description
Bit Pong is based on the 1972 classic Pong game. It is a table tennis-themed arcade sports video game with a modern twist. It consists of two paddles that players used to volley a small ball back and forth across a screen. The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible by forcing the ball to go past the opponent's paddle.
